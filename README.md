# HIvsAI
The HIvsAI (Human interaction vs Artificial intelligence) project is to compare the design and functionality of a human built web page vs that created by AI tools.

## Idea

Everywhere I look, social media, forums, work, new AI tools and the feats they've achieved are being discussed. And invaribly the controversial idea of 'AI will replace X work force' appears, with AI replacing coders and designers being a hot topic with the release of tools such as Chat-GPT, Microsoft Designers, GalileoAI, etc.
